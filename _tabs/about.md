### Welcome to Grand Strategy Lab!
I'm a C++ programmer with professional experience in `Unreal Engine 4` and `Unreal Engine 5`, but here I focus on something different, a custom engine built with `SDL3` and `Vulkan`.

This blog is dedicated to exploring the technical challenges of grand strategy game development. My main goal is to experiment with and develop a custom grand strategy engine in `C++`. While I use `C++`, my approach leans more toward `C` with templates, I prefer raw performance and minimal abstraction over traditional OOP.

My passion for this field comes from [Europa Universalis IV](https://store.steampowered.com/app/236850/Europa_Universalis_IV/), the best game ever, and my love for pushing computers to their limits.
